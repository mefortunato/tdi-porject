# Flask Application for TDI 12-day project

This is an example application built using the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="_blank">Flask</a> Python microframework. Enter a stock ticker symbol below to see historical closing prices for the past 5 years. The data is queried from the <a href="https://iextrading.com/developer/" target="_blank">IEX Financial Data API</a>, converted into a <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank">Pandas DataFrame</a>, and an interactive plot is created using <a href="https://plot.ly/" target="_blank">Plotly</a>.
